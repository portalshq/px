## Releases

**Always use `./scripts/publish-all.sh` to publish a new version.** Do not manually bump versions, commit release tags, or push release commits.

### Workflow

```bash
./scripts/publish-all.sh patch   # 0.5.8 → 0.5.9
./scripts/publish-all.sh minor   # 0.5.8 → 0.6.0
./scripts/publish-all.sh major   # 0.5.8 → 1.0.0
./scripts/publish-all.sh 2.3.0   # explicit version
```

The script handles the entire release:

1. Verifies clean working tree on `main`
2. Bumps versions across Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, pyproject.toml, and package.json (11 workspace packages)
3. Runs pre-publish validation (version consistency, tag consistency, type freshness)
4. Builds TypeScript type definitions
5. Commits the release
6. Creates annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`
7. Pushes to origin
8. Triggers GitHub Actions publish workflow

### Prerequisites

- Must be on `main` with a clean working tree
- Must have push access to origin (run `gh auth login` if needed)
- If the `production` GitHub environment requires approval, approve the workflow run at https://github.com/portalshq/px/actions

### Registry trust (trusted publishing)

All registries publish via OIDC trusted publishing — there are no long-lived
publish secrets. Each target needs a one-time trusted-publisher entry pointing
at repo `portalshq/px` plus the workflow file (and `production` env):

- npm (`@portalshq/narrativeengine`, `@portalshq/px`): package Settings →
  Trusted Publisher on npmjs.com. Workflows use `id-token: write` and npm ≥ 11.5.1.
- PyPI (`narrativeengine`, `px-sdk`): project Settings → Publishing on pypi.org.
- crates.io (`px-core`): crate Settings → Trusted Publishers on crates.io.

Do not reintroduce `NPM_TOKEN`, `MATURIN_PYPI_TOKEN`, or `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
secrets — the publish workflows are tokenless by design.

### What the script does NOT do

- Does not run tests (run `just test-all` before releasing)
- Does not update CHANGELOG (manual step if needed)

### Release Verification and Security

Px releases use GitHub OIDC (OpenID Connect) and Sigstore for cryptographic verification. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/cli-release.yml`) generates:

- `SHA256SUMS` - Checksums of all release artifacts
- `SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json` - Sigstore bundle proving the checksums were signed by GitHub Actions
- `release-metadata.json` - Metadata including the pinned Lore client version and artifact digests
- `release-metadata.sigstore.json` - Sigstore bundle proving the metadata was signed by GitHub Actions

#### Cross-Origin Lore Verification

Px depends on the Lore CLI, which is published in a separate repository (`portalshq/lore`). The release metadata includes:

- Lore version pinned in Px's source code (`crates/px-core/src/server/version.rs`)
- Lore artifact manifest URL (expected to be from `portalshq/lore/releases`)
- Lore artifact manifest SHA256 digest
- Lore signature bundle URL (expected to be from `portalshq/lore/releases`)

The parent repository's verification script (`cloud/infra/pulumi/scripts/verify-and-promote-px-release.sh`) performs **cross-origin verification**:

1. **Verify Px's authenticity**: Checks that Px's `SHA256SUMS` and `release-metadata.json` were signed by the `narrativeengine` repository's GitHub OIDC workflow
2. **Verify Px's artifacts**: Confirms downloaded binaries match the signed checksums
3. **Cross-check Lore claims**: Independently fetches Lore's SHA256SUMS from GitHub and verifies its digest matches what Px's metadata claims
4. **Verify Lore's authenticity**: Checks that Lore's SHA256SUMS was signed by the `portalshq/lore` repository's GitHub OIDC workflow

This is **not same-origin verification**. Px's metadata is a *claim* that gets cross-validated against the actual Lore release from an independent source. The security chain:

```
GitHub OIDC (narrativeengine) → Px release → Px's Lore claim
                                                 ↓
                                         Independent fetch from GitHub
                                                 ↓
GitHub OIDC (lore) → Lore release → Actual Lore artifacts
```

You cannot forge a Px release that claims to depend on a malicious Lore version because:
- The malicious Lore version wouldn't exist at the claimed GitHub URL
- Even if it existed, its digest wouldn't match Px's claim
- Even if the digest matched, it wouldn't be signed by the Lore repo's OIDC

This dual-source-of-trust model requires compromising both repositories independently to break the chain.
