# px — PX protocol

**PX is a protocol that makes narrative resources addressable, resolvable, and interoperable across tools, storage systems, formats, and AI workflows.**

Characters, locations, scenes, props, and entire fictional repositories — PX gives each one a stable URI, a human-and-machine-readable manifest, a content-addressed history, and a resolver that connects them all.

In the same way that IPFS content-addressed files and OCI container-addressed images, PX is **narrative-addressed** — a universal namespace for the building blocks of stories.

---

## Why PX?

Today, narrative assets live in silos:
- Worldbuilding docs in Notion or Google Docs
- Character sheets in spreadsheets
- Concept art in Dropbox or S3
- Scene breakdowns in Final Draft or Fade In
- AI prompts scattered across chat logs
- 3D assets on Sketchfab or Polycam

None of these tools talk to each other. PX unifies them under a single addressing and resolution layer.

px://toystory/character/woody
px://toystory/location/andys-room
px://toystory/scene/pizza-planet
px://toystory/prop/andy-hat
```

## Installation

### Installation Script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/portalshq/px/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash && npx skills add portalshq/px
```

The one-liner installs the `px` CLI, the bundled `px-mcp-server`, and the agent skills. The MCP server is dormant by default; agent clients start it on demand over stdio so sandboxed agents can use PX through host-side CLI proxy calls.

<!-- ### CLI & Server (Rust — compile from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/portalshq/px.git
cd px
cargo build --release

# Binaries land in target/release/
#   px          — CLI tool
#   px-server   — HTTP resolver server
```

### Python SDK (prebuilt wheel, no Rust needed)

```bash
pip install narrativeengine
```

```python
from narrativeengine import create_block, generate_candidate, render_lore_summary

block = create_block("char-1", "A brave adventurer")
candidate = generate_candidate(block)
```

### TypeScript SDK (prebuilt binary, no Rust needed)

```bash
npm install @portalshq/narrativeengine
```

```typescript
import { createBlock } from "@portalshq/narrativeengine";

const block = createBlock("char-1", "A brave adventurer");
``` -->

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a repository (prompts for provider on first run)
px init toystory

# Initialize with local provider
px init toystory --provider local

# Configure provider only (no repository)
px init --provider local

# Initialize with remote provider
px init --provider remote --remote-url lore://127.0.0.1:41337 --workspace-id my-workspace

# Initialize with Portals Cloud
px auth login
px init --provider portals-cloud

# Inspect or clear the OS-keyring-backed session
px auth status
px auth logout

# Check system status
px status

# Run diagnostics
px doctor

# Run diagnostics with auto-repair
px doctor --repair
```

Portals Cloud uses `grpcs://lore.portals.works` on standard TLS port 443. Login is
the only interactive VCS step; repository operations remain noninteractive and
return an actionable `px auth login` error when credentials are missing or
expired. Lore automatically exchanges the eight-hour login session for a
five-minute token scoped to the single repository used by init, clone, pull,
sync, push, and locking. CI uses a revocable service-account API key
exchange; do not store long-lived bearer tokens in CI variables.

`px install lore` installs the exact `portalshq/lore` release compiled into
that Px version. It downloads the installer from the same release tag,
verifies its pinned SHA-256 before execution, and explicitly selects the
Portals fork. It never executes the mutable `main` installer or silently falls
back to an upstream Lore binary. Production release metadata binds this Lore
client version to Px's signed checksum manifest.

CI reads the API key from its secret store and passes it to Lore over stdin,
so the secret is absent from process arguments and command logs:

```bash
export PORTALS_CLOUD_API_KEY="${CI_PORTALS_CLOUD_API_KEY}"
px auth login --api-key
```

Use `--api-key-env NAME` to select a different secret environment variable.

### Create a Repository

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
px init toystory

# See what you created
ls toystory/
# → .px/  repository.yaml  characters/  locations/  scenes/  props/
```

### Create & Inspect Entities

```bash
# Create a character
px create character woody -u toystory -n "Woody"

# Create a location
px create location andys-room -u toystory -n "Andy's Room"

# Set properties
px set px://toystory/character/woody toy_type human
px set px://toystory/character/woody homeworld "px://toystory/location/andys-room"

# Resolve a manifest
px resolve px://toystory/character/woody

# Query a specific field
px resolve px://toystory/character/woody#properties.toy_type
# → human

# Resolve a subtree
px resolve px://toystory/character/woody properties
```

### Version Control

```bash
# View commit history
px history px://toystory/character/woody

# Create branches
px branch toystory canon

# Sync with remote
px sync toystory

# Push to remote
px push toystory
```

### Output Formats

```bash
px resolve px://toystory/character/woody -f json
px resolve px://toystory/character/woody -f yaml
```

## Core Primitives

PX is built on four primitives:

### 1. URI — Identity

A `px://` URI identifies any narrative resource. Version and branch are **orthogonal selectors** passed alongside the URI — never encoded in the path (mirrors Git, OCI, and package managers).

```text
px://toystory/character/woody#references.appears_in
────┬── ───┬──── ────┬──── ──────┬────── ─────────────┬───────────
 scheme repository  entity_type entity_id          fragment (query)
```

### 2. Manifest — Current State

A YAML manifest is the durable representation of a narrative resource. It is simultaneously:

- **Human-editable** — readable by toybox-builders
- **Machine-editable** — structured, schema-validated
- **Agent-readable** — subtree-queryable for AI workflows
- **Portable** — no runtime dependency, just a file
- **Signable** — hash the content, sign the hash (Ed25519 in v0+)
- **Versionable** — the manifest *is* what gets committed

```yaml
id: "px://toystory/character/woody"
name: "Woody"
entity_type: character
version: 17
properties:
  homeworld: "px://toystory/location/andys-room"
  toy_type: human
representations:
  reference_image:
    hash: "blake3:e3b0c44..."
    format: png
provenance:
  model: "midjourney-v6"
  prompt_hash: "blake3:abc123..."
```

### 3. Commit — History

Commits are content-addressed (BLAKE3) snapshots with patch metadata. Full history and revision identity live in the VCS, keeping manifests bounded and avoiding self-referential revision pointers.

### 4. Resolver — URI → Manifest

The resolver turns a `px://` URI into a manifest (or a subtree of one). With optional selectors for branch or commit hash, it supports versioned resolution and fragment-based queries for efficient data access.

### Scene Clips as Representations

Scenes can own generated video clips the same way characters own reference images. A generated clip is not usually a representation of one character; it is a representation of a scene, with references back to the characters, locations, props, and style guides that shaped it. A scene clip is stored as a content-addressed representation (for example `clip-01`, identified by its BLAKE3 hash), not as a field on any single character.

The scene manifest remains simple and durable:

```yaml
id: "px://toystory/scene/pizza-planet"
name: "Pizza Planet"
entity_type: scene
version: 3
properties:
  summary: "Woody and Buzz enter a crowded pizza-planet while searching for passage off Andy's Room."
  time_of_day: night
  mood: tense
references:
  characters:
    - "px://toystory/character/woody"
    - "px://toystory/character/buzzlightyear"
  location: "px://toystory/location/pizza-planet"
representations:
  clip-01:
    hash: "blake3:af1349b9..."
    format: mp4
    uri: "clip-01.mp4"
```

When resolved with provenance, PX returns versioned per-file provenance for the manifest and each direct representation. This keeps generation metadata attached to the committed files without requiring users to manage the underlying VCS directly.

```yaml
manifest:
  id: "px://toystory/scene/pizza-planet"
  name: "Pizza Planet"
  entity_type: scene
  version: 3
  representations:
    clip-01:
      hash: "blake3:af1349b9..."
      format: mp4
      uri: "clip-01.mp4"
provenance:
  revision: "a72c9f3b..."
  files:
    - role: manifest
      path: "scene/pizza-planet.yaml"
      provenance:
        px.provenance.kind: edit
        px.provenance.author: toybox-builder
    - role: representation
      name: clip-01
      path: "scene/clip-01.mp4"
      uri: "clip-01.mp4"
      hash: "blake3:af1349b9..."
      format: mp4
      provenance:
        px.provenance.kind: generation
        px.provenance.model: video-generator
        px.provenance.prompt.address: "blake3:b4d2..."
```

## Entity Types

| Type | Example URI | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `character` | `px://toystory/character/woody` | Persistent character with identity across scenes/episodes |
| `location` | `px://toystory/location/andys-room` | Spatial location within a fictional repository |
| `scene` | `px://toystory/scene/pizza-planet` | Narrative scene — participants, timeline, events |
| `prop` | `px://toystory/prop/andy-hat` | Physical object with materials, variants, ownership |
| `group` | `px://toystory/group/buzz-and-woody-flying` | Mixed-media groups |
| `world` | `px://toystory/world/toystory` | The repository itself — rules, canon, top-level metadata |

---

## Repository Layout

Each repository is a Lore working tree on disk:

```text
toystory/                    ← repository root (Lore checkout)
├── .lore/                    ← Lore version-control state
├── .px/
│   └── config.yaml          ← repository configuration
├── repository.yaml            ← world manifest
├── character/
│   ├── woody.yaml
│   └── slinky.yaml
├── location/
│   └── andys-room.yaml
├── scene/
│   └── pizza-planet.yaml
└── prop/
```


---

## Primitives CLI Examples

Command-line examples for the [core primitives](./primitives.md), intended for humans working in a host shell. Agents must not execute these — agentic execution goes exclusively through `px-mcp-server` (see `px-repo`, `px-resolve`, `px-update`).

```bash
px create scene pizza-planet -u toystory -n "Pizza Planet"
px add px://toystory/scene/pizza-planet clip-01 ./pizza-planet-clip-01.mp4 --format mp4 -m "Add pizza-planet scene clip"
```

```bash
px resolve px://toystory/scene/pizza-planet --provenance
```


---

## Representation downloads and presigned URLs

Create a temporary download URL with
`px presign 25th-chapter/character/nathan-gunn item`.
See the [px presign reference](docs/generated/commands/presign.md) for entity
and representation arguments, file lookup, configuration, and SDK examples.

---

## MCP Server (mandatory for agents)

Agents MUST issue all PX operations exclusively through the `px-mcp-server` MCP tools (`px_<command>`). The `px` CLI is NOT available for agentic use — never shell out, never follow `px ...` shell examples.

The standard PX installer bundles the native `px-mcp-server` binary with `px`. If the MCP server is missing or broken, rerun the standard PX installer from a host shell.

The MCP server is not a daemon; agent clients start it on demand over stdio (see `docs/authored/mcp/install.md` for client configuration), and it proxies tool calls to the host PX installation.

## Available MCP Tools

Every PX command is available as an MCP tool with a `px_` prefix and dashes/spaces converted to underscores. For example:

- `px_resolve` — resolve a PX URI to its manifest or a subtree
- `px_create` — create a new entity manifest
- `px_resolve` with `path` — query a subtree from a manifest
- `px_set` — set a property on an entity manifest
- `px_add` — add a file representation to an entity manifest
- `px_commit` — commit changes to a repository

Per-tool parameters are documented under `docs/generated/mcp/<tool>.md` (generated from the same command definitions as the MCP server itself). Tool arguments use MCP field names (for example `branch`, `commit`, `format`, `include_blobs`); pass the branch explicitly on every call that accepts one — do not rely on whichever branch happens to be checked out. The CLI reference (`docs/generated/cli.md`, `docs/generated/commands/`) and shell examples elsewhere in these docs are for humans in host shells only and MUST NOT be used as agent instructions.


## MCP Server Configuration

Add to your agent's MCP configuration (e.g., `~/.codex/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "px": {
      "command": "/bin/sh",
      "args": [
        "-lc",
        "PX_DIR=\"$HOME/.px\" exec px-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Connect with Codex

Codex stores MCP configuration in `~/.codex/config.toml` alongside the rest of its config. The Codex CLI, the ChatGPT desktop app, and the IDE extension all share that MCP configuration, so you only need to register `px` once.

Add the server with the CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add px --env PX_DIR="$HOME/.px" -- /bin/sh -lc 'exec px-mcp-server'
```

If `px-mcp-server` is not on `PATH`, use the full installed path instead, usually `~/.local/bin/px-mcp-server` or `/usr/local/bin/px-mcp-server`.

You can also configure it manually in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.px]
command = "/bin/sh"
args = ["-lc", "PX_DIR=\"$HOME/.px\" exec px-mcp-server"]
enabled = true
```

Project-scoped config works too for trusted projects:

```toml
[mcp_servers.px]
command = "/bin/sh"
args = ["-lc", "PX_DIR=\"$HOME/.px\" exec px-mcp-server"]
enabled = true
```

Use the same block in `.codex/config.toml` inside a trusted project if you want the server scoped to that repository.

## Connect with Claude Code

Register the server for your user account with the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add px --env PX_DIR="$HOME/.px" --scope user -- /bin/sh -lc 'exec px-mcp-server'
```

If `px-mcp-server` is not on `PATH`, use the full installed path instead, usually `~/.local/bin/px-mcp-server` or `/usr/local/bin/px-mcp-server`.

## Other MCP Clients

Claude Desktop and other MCP clients use the same stdio pattern. Add a server entry that runs the bundled `px-mcp-server` command on demand, and keep `PX_DIR` pointed at your PX workspace if you need a non-default data directory.

Example host-side launch command:

```bash
/bin/sh -lc 'PX_DIR="$HOME/.px" exec px-mcp-server'
```

Use the same command/args form in any client that supports stdio MCP servers.

Inside sandboxes, use the MCP tools for all PX operations. Direct `px` CLI commands are for humans in host-local shells only and MUST NOT be used as agent instructions.

## Design Principles

1. **Content-addressed** — Every piece of content is identified by its cryptographic hash. Manifests are immutable once committed.

2. **URI-addressed** — Every entity has a stable, portable URI. URIs are never invalidated by renames or moves.

3. **Human-readable** — YAML manifests are readable by toybox-builders and AI agents alike.

4. **Portable** — No runtime dependencies. A manifest is just a YAML file. A repository is just a Git repo.

5. **AI-native** — Subtree queries let AI agents fetch exactly the data they need. Provenance tracking records generation metadata.

6. **Schema-validated** — All manifests conform to a JSON Schema. Invalid manifests are rejected at commit time.

7. **Decentralized** — Repositories are Git repositories. They can be cloned, forked, merged, and published independently.

8. **Extensible** — New entity types, representation formats, and merge strategies can be added without breaking existing data.
