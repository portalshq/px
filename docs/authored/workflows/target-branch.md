## Target Branch

The **target branch** is whichever branch the entity's accepted work is meant to land on. It is **not always `main`** — resolve it per task, in this order:

1. If the user named a branch for this work (e.g., "we're doing this on the `classic` branch"), that branch is the target.
2. Otherwise, the branch the entity was created on or first resolved from is the target.
3. Otherwise, resolve the repository's configured default branch (and the provider/global default if needed). Do not assume it is `main`.

Establish the target branch at creation/first-resolve time and carry it forward for the rest of the task. Every promotion promotes to the **resolved target branch**, never a hardcoded `main`. When reporting or asking about promotion, name the target branch explicitly (e.g., "promote to `classic`") rather than saying "main" generically.
