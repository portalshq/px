## Global Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
|     --local | Resolve repository reads from an explicitly checked-out local working tree |  |
|     --remote | Resolve repository reads through the configured Lore server (the default) |  |
| -d, --base-dir | Base directory for repository repositories. Defaults to $PX\_DIR, or ~/.px if unset |  |
| -v, --verbose | Enable verbose debug logging |  |


## Output Formats
Most commands support `--format` (`-f`) with values `yaml` (default) or `json`.

When stdout is not a terminal, JSON is used automatically. Override with `$PX_OUTPUT`.


## Common Examples
```bash
# Initialize a repository
px init toystory

# Create an entity
px create character woody -u toystory -n "Woody"

# Resolve a manifest
px resolve px://toystory/character/woody

# Query a subtree
px query px://toystory/character/woody properties

# View commit history
px history px://toystory/character/woody
```
