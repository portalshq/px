description: Persist changes to existing PX entities via px-mcp-server (px_add, px_set, px_commit), including narrative property updates and every user-visible creative iteration, and manage promotion of accepted revisions to the current working branch. The px CLI is not available for agentic use. Use whenever a user refines, regenerates, selects, rejects, endorses, or promotes an entity whose PX URI was established earlier in the task, even if the user does not mention PX again.

# PX Update

Use this skill whenever existing PX entity content changes, especially during iterative creative work.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Making changes to entity properties in a workflow
- Generating new assets as part of a workflow
- Storing assets back into the entity manifest
- Refining, regenerating, selecting, rejecting, endorsing, or promoting an entity whose PX URI was established earlier in the task
For creating or first resolving entities, use `px-resolve`. For repository-level init/pull/branch, use `px-repo`. For questions about `px` CLI syntax from humans, use `px-cli-reference` (read-only; never execute CLI commands).

## MCP Server (mandatory for agents)

Agents MUST issue all PX operations exclusively through the `px-mcp-server` MCP tools (`px_<command>`). The `px` CLI is NOT available for agentic use — never shell out, never follow `px ...` shell examples.

The standard PX installer bundles the native `px-mcp-server` binary with `px`. If the MCP server is missing or broken, rerun the standard PX installer from a host shell.

The MCP server is not a daemon; agent clients start it on demand over stdio (see `docs/authored/mcp/install.md` for client configuration), and it proxies tool calls to the host PX installation.

## Available MCP Tools

Every PX command is available as an MCP tool with a `px_` prefix and dashes/spaces converted to underscores. For example:

- `px_resolve` — resolve a PX URI to its manifest or a subtree
- `px_create` — create a new entity manifest
- `px_resolve` with `path` — query a subtree from a manifest
- `px_set` — set a property on an entity manifest
- `px_add` — add a file representation to an entity manifest
- `px_commit` — commit changes to a repository

Per-tool parameters are documented under `docs/generated/mcp/<tool>.md` (generated from the same command definitions as the MCP server itself). Tool arguments use MCP field names (for example `branch`, `commit`, `format`, `include_blobs`); pass the branch explicitly on every call that accepts one — do not rely on whichever branch happens to be checked out. The CLI reference (`docs/generated/cli.md`, `docs/generated/commands/`) and shell examples elsewhere in these docs are for humans in host shells only and MUST NOT be used as agent instructions.


## Repository Context (`repository.yaml`)

`repository.yaml` is the repository's manifest and the sole source of truth for project-wide context. It owns durable global visual or narrative style, reusable asset conventions, global exclusions, and canonical references through its `properties`, `representations`, and `references`.

Before creating an entity or generating content, resolve the repository.yaml from the same target branch as the entity work (via `px_resolve` on the repository URI). Read its `properties`, `representations`, and `references`, and resolve only the referenced resources relevant to the requested work. Treat repository context as the project-wide baseline; entity-specific identity, behavior, and representation data apply as refinements. Keep entity manifests focused on identity and entity-specific facts; do not add a repository-level summary or reference for every entity.

If project and entity instructions truly conflict, pause and ask the user for direction rather than choosing one. If the repository.yaml cannot be read, warn the user and ask how to proceed; never silently generate without project context.

Update `repository.yaml` only when the user explicitly defines or approves a project-wide property or reference. If entity work reveals a potentially reusable global fact, present it as a proposed repository update and wait for user approval before writing it. Preserve existing global context when adding an approved change. Never promote inferred project-wide facts into `repository.yaml` as part of an entity update.

Unless the user explicitly requests a different provider or storage location, call `px_init` with no provider argument and preserve the configured provider and default PX directory. Never infer a local provider from an example. Never choose an isolated storage location merely to isolate a repository. Pass a provider only when the user explicitly requests a provider change, and a storage location only when the user explicitly names one.

**No tagging.** Lore VCS has no native tag support — branches are the only mechanism for human-readable names on a revision point. Do not append tags to URIs.

Checking the current workspace is not required: PX usually stores all repositories in a centralized directory unless configured otherwise.


## Target Branch

The **target branch** is whichever branch the entity's accepted work is meant to land on. It is **not always `main`** — resolve it per task, in this order:

1. If the user named a branch for this work (e.g., "we're doing this on the `classic` branch"), that branch is the target.
2. Otherwise, the branch the entity was created on or first resolved from is the target.
3. Otherwise, default to `main`. when a branch is not specified, px defaults to `main`.

Establish the target branch at creation/first-resolve time and carry it forward for the rest of the task. Every promotion promotes to the **resolved target branch**, never a hardcoded `main`. When reporting or asking about promotion, name the target branch explicitly (e.g., "promote to `classic`") rather than saying "main" generically.


## Active Entity Continuity

Once a PX entity URI is established in a task, carry forward:

- the active URI, repository, entity type, and entity ID
- the active revision branch and the **target branch** (see `target-branch.md`)
- stable representation keys such as `character_sheet`, `face_sheet`, `portrait`, `model_sheet`, or `reference_image`
- user-approved identity constraints and negative constraints

Later turns that keep refining the same entity are continuity work. They must trigger `px-update` even when the user does not mention PX again and does not say "save" or "commit" or repeat the URI. Carry forward stable representation keys and identity constraints so attributes do not get dropped between turns.


## Revision Branches

Use a revision branch for ordinary iteration:

```text
revision-<entity-type>-<entity-id>
```

Example: `revision-character-atlas`.

Commit every accepted user-visible iteration to the revision branch in the same turn. An accepted iteration means a concrete candidate the agent generated or revised in response to the user's current refinement request, unless the user explicitly said not to save it, asked only to brainstorm, or the generation failed. Multiple tiny corrections in one turn may be grouped into one accepted-revision commit; do not wait across many turns to batch revisions.

Rejected or superseded versions should remain traceable in branch history. Do not delete historical assets or replace history to make a rejected variant disappear.

If the user selects an older variant, restore that content as a new commit at the tip of the revision branch rather than rewriting history. If a reference such as "#2" is ambiguous or stale, resolve the mapping from the visible candidate set or ask a brief clarification before persisting the selection.


## Promotion to the Target Branch

Promotion moves the endorsed tip of a revision branch onto the target branch. **Promotion always requires a signal of acceptance** — either the user stating it explicitly, or the agent proactively asking and getting a yes, or (in exactly one case below) an auto-promotion that is disclosed to the user. Silence is never acceptance.

There are five points in a workflow where acceptance is checked. Each is a **proactive ask**, except dependency-triggered promotion, which is an **auto-promotion with disclosure**.

### 1. End-of-turn ask
After committing a revision to the revision branch, close the turn by asking, briefly, whether to promote it to the target branch or keep iterating.

> "Atlas updated on the revision branch. Should I promote this to `<target-branch>`, or do we need more changes?"

### 2. Sentiment-triggered ask
Treat conversational affirmations ("looks great," "perfect," "that's the one," "thanks") as a signal the user is likely satisfied — but this alone is **not** acceptance. Ask explicitly before promoting.

> "Glad you like it! Want me to promote this to `<target-branch>`?"

### 3. Context-switch ask
If the user pivots to a new PX URI or a different task while the current entity has an unpromoted revision-branch tip, pause and ask before executing the switch.

> "Before we move on to the spaceship engine — want me to merge the recent Atlas revisions into `<target-branch>` first?"

### 4. Dependency-triggered auto-promotion (the one exception)
If the user asks to use a currently-revised entity in a new downstream context (e.g., "generate a scene using Atlas" while Atlas sits on a revision branch), auto-promote the endorsed revision-branch tip to the target branch immediately, without asking first — downstream generation must read from the target branch for continuity. Always disclose that this happened; do not promote silently.

> "Using the latest Atlas revision — I've promoted it to `<target-branch>` so the scene generation stays consistent."

### 5. Milestone bulk-merge ask
When the user indicates a session, task, or milestone is complete, check for any unpromoted `revision-*` branches across entities touched in the task. Summarize them and ask for one bulk approval.

> "You have unmerged revisions for Atlas and the Spaceship. Shall I promote both to `<target-branch>` before we wrap up?"

### Explicit user statement
The user can always state acceptance directly, and this satisfies the acceptance requirement immediately — at any of the checkpoints above, in reply to one of the proactive asks, or unprompted. Do not require a fixed magic phrase like "lock it in": interpret the intent behind whatever wording the user actually uses. This includes, at minimum:

- **Direct commands:** "lock it in," "make it canonical," "promote it," "merge it," "commit it to `<target-branch>`," "ship it."
- **Direct affirmatives in answer to a proactive ask:** "yes," "yep," "do it," "go ahead," "please," "sure," a thumbs-up-equivalent reply — any of these said in direct response to one of the five checkpoint questions counts as acceptance for that specific promotion.
- **Instructions that presuppose promotion:** "move to the next entity" (after being asked whether to promote first), "that's final," "we're done with Atlas," "use that version going forward."
If a reply is ambiguous as acceptance (e.g., it's unclear whether "yes" answers the promotion question or something else asked in the same turn), resolve it from context or ask a one-line clarification rather than guessing either way. Explicit statement is a valid mechanism but, per the above, is never the *only* mechanism the agent relies on — the agent must still proactively ask per checkpoints 1–3 and 5, and disclose per checkpoint 4.

### If declined or unresolved
If the user says not yet, keep working on the revision branch and re-ask at the next natural checkpoint (points 1–5 above). Never promote to the target branch without a yes from one of these five paths.

## Executing a Promotion

Once acceptance is confirmed (by any path above):

1. Resolve the endorsed revision branch at its current tip via `px_resolve`.
2. Switch to the target branch via `px_switch`.
3. Apply the same content-addressed representations/properties from the endorsed revision.
4. Commit with a promotion message naming the source revision branch and commit via `px_commit`.
5. Resolve the target branch and verify representation hashes match the endorsed revision.
If promotion cannot complete without overwriting unrelated dirty content on the target branch, stop and report that promotion was blocked. Do not reset, revert, or discard user-authored content.

## Reporting

Revision saved, awaiting acceptance:

```text
PX: Atlas revision saved on revision-character-atlas at a1b2c3d; character_sheet updated; <target-branch> unchanged.
Should I promote this to <target-branch>, or do we need more changes?
```

Promoted:

```text
PX: Atlas promoted to <target-branch> at d4e5f6a from revision-character-atlas a1b2c3d.
```

Auto-promoted for a dependency:

```text
PX: Atlas revision auto-promoted to <target-branch> at d4e5f6a to satisfy downstream generation.
```

Failed:

```text
PX persistence failed: Atlas revision was generated but not committed.
```


## Update Pipeline

1. Switch to the target branch if not already there.
2. Resolve the repository.yaml and gather the relevant project context (see `repository-stewardship.md`).
3. Resolve the entity explicitly from the active revision branch via `px_resolve` (`uri`, `branch`), not from implicit defaults.
4. Gather every relevant project and entity property, representation, reference, and negative constraint that affects identity, continuity, style, exclusions, or the requested medium (use `px_query` with `uri` and `path` for subtrees).
5. Generate or edit the requested content using the resolved project and entity context as the source of truth.
6. Persist the result in the same turn:
   - `px_add` (`uri`, `key`, `file`, `format`, `message`) for asset revisions
   - `px_set` (`uri`, `key`, `value`) for simple property-only updates
   - when several files/properties form one logical revision, update the structured manifest and make one `px_commit` (`repository`, `message`) after updating
7. Store assets by BLAKE3 content hash, not SHA-256 — `px_content_hash` (`file`) should return a `blake3:` value.
8. Record generation provenance with the revision: `model`, `prompt_hash`, `parameters` (when relevant), `derived_from` (source URIs/commits/hashes), `created_at` (when available).
9. Verify branch-specific resolution after the commit — check that the representation key, hash, and description match the accepted revision.
9. In the final response, report persistence in one concise line, then apply the relevant acceptance checkpoint (see `promotion.md`).

## Data Placement

- `properties` — narrative facts and durable identity constraints.
- `representations` — current addressable assets, under stable semantic keys (e.g., `character_sheet` across all of Atlas's character-sheet revisions).
- Commit messages — revision notes (`revision_summary`). Do not create an append-only `revision_log` property; PX/Lore history is the revision log.
- `metadata` — extension data that isn't narrative canon (e.g., per-representation provenance the manifest format can't otherwise express).

## Branch and Version Truth

Branch heads and commit history are VCS state — do not store or repair them inside entity manifests. Treat any branch-head data a PX tool exposes as derived status only.

Do not use commit `parent` fields as validation truth unless the current PX/Lore version documents them as reliable. Count commit IDs/messages and verify branch-specific resolves instead.

Some PX tools auto-commit (`px_add`, `px_set`). Do not call `px_commit` afterward unless you intentionally made additional uncommitted changes.

Note: `px_add`, `px_set`, `px_create`, and `px_unset` stage, commit, and push automatically. `px_resolve` reads the configured server by default, so successful mutations are immediately visible to other clients. If a push fails, the commit remains local and PX reports the recovery command. Use `px resolve --local <uri>` only to inspect uncommitted filesystem changes.

## Character Creation and Character Sheets

Treat a request to create a character, character sheet, reference sheet, or other character visual as a persistence workflow. Do not leave generated assets only in the conversation or on a local filesystem.

1. Create or resolve the character entity on its target branch (see `resolve-workflow.md`).
2. Add every accepted generated asset with a stable semantic representation key via `px_add`. Use `character_sheet` for a complete three-view reference sheet and `portrait` for a portrait.
3. Commit the representation and any properties that describe the accepted character in the same turn (`px_add` and `px_set` may commit automatically; otherwise run one `px_commit` after updating the manifest).
4. Resolve the entity from the branch that received the commit and confirm its manifest contains the expected representation key, URI, format, and BLAKE3 hash.

Keep the manifest current whenever a character is created or a character sheet is generated. A file is not complete until it is represented in the entity manifest and committed to PX.

## Entity Variants

When the user asks to create a variant of an existing entity, create a new entity. Never replace the base entity's canonical identity or overwrite its representations to impersonate a variant.

1. Resolve the base entity and its target branch.
2. Create a distinct entity ID that describes the variant via `px_create`, for example `claire-cole-summer-dress` for `px://25th-chapter/character/claire-cole-summer-dress`.
3. Persist the variant's applicable properties and representations via `px_set` / `px_add`, then commit its manifest via `px_commit`.
4. Update the base entity's `properties.variants` value to the complete, deduplicated list of PX URIs for every known variant, including the new URI. Preserve existing entries; do not record local paths or bare IDs.
5. Commit the base-manifest update and resolve both entities to verify the variant and the base entity's `variants` property.

For example, the base entity `px://25th-chapter/character/claire-cole` keeps:

```yaml
properties:
  variants:
    - px://25th-chapter/character/claire-cole-summer-dress
    - px://25th-chapter/character/claire-cole-riot-gear
```

Use the same target branch for the base update and variant unless the user explicitly asks for a different branch. Report both committed entity URIs and their revisions.
