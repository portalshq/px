# PX Skill: Repository Management

A repository is the top-level container that holds entities (characters, locations, assets, etc.) and their PX/Lore version history.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Initializing a new PX repository
- Cloning or pulling an existing repository
- Creating a new branch at the repository level
For creating or resolving individual entities, use `px-resolve`. For revising entity content and persisting iterations, use `px-update`. For questions about `px` CLI syntax from humans, use `ask-px` (read-only; never execute CLI commands).
