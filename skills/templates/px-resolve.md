# PX Resolve

Use this skill to create entities, resolve PX URIs, and gather entity context for creative workflows.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Creating new entities (e.g., characters, locations, items, events)
- Resolving PX URIs into manifests
- Querying subtree data for creative workflows
For revising entity content and persisting iterations, use `px-update`. For repository-level init/pull/branch, use `px-repo`. For questions about `px` CLI syntax from humans, use `ask-px` (read-only; never execute CLI commands).
